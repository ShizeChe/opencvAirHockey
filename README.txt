Description:
Opencv Air Hockey is a webcam interactive game aims to reconstruct a real air hockey experience with the help from the opencv module. The key feature of this game is controlling your mallet with any object you have to move it on the screen and seeks opportunity to hit the puck and score on your opponent. The default mode of this game is two-player mode, in which two players control their mallet with two objects. A player wins if his/her score comes to 6. The user can also choose one-player mode, in which a game AI will control the other mallet and play with the user. The user can choose the difficulty that fits his/her level of mastery. The game also contains a practice mode that helps the user to increase proficiency by controlling the puck to hit the targets on the screen.

How to run:
First make sure the files background.jpg, marble.jpg and cmu_112_graphics.py are in the same folder with the actual program opencvAirHoceky.py. Then go to the folder in terminal and run from there by using the command "python3 opencvAirHockey.py". Running from terminal is preferred because sometime it's hard to give camera access to vscode.
